# Web Mini Project
Web Mini Project on Invited Talks Info.

## Invited Talks Infomation System
A PHP based website to provide info on the external speakers coming to college and the topics they have covered. This system helps the cultural and technical coordinator keep track of the guest speakers and invite more speakers from specific research areas. The website provides a report with information about the speaker, topic covered and the date of the event. This also allows the coordinators to call speakers based on topics not previously covered.

This is a session based login system along with a secure backend script to sanitize the user input to ensure that only the coordinator has acces to the website. It automatically redirects the user to the next page, so the user just needs to provide input and chill ;)

Check out the **synopsis** folder for a brief report of the project. 


## Requirements:
- XAMPP (latest version)
- Database Schema (I have not included the schema here keeping in mind my college privacy conditions regarding databases)

## Getting Started:
- Configure XAMPP according to your preferred directory and use a PHP backend if prompted.
- Clone or paste the code into the ```htdocs``` folder in  the XAMPP directory.
- Type ```localhost://web_mini_project/index.html``` in your web browser and go.

## TODO:
- Fix UI and CSS
- Add email feature to send the report to the concerned coordinator via email
